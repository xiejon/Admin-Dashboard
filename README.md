## Key Takeaways 

CSS Grid 
- I restricted myself to using CSS Grid for the entire design. By the end of this project, I was comfortable using Grid to place and subdivide containers.

Design Principles 
- I made decisions about how wide a container should be, what font I should use, what background color, with consideration in regards to user experience.

Neat Code 
- I tried to organize my HTML and CSS in a logical order to allow for better readability. 

## Areas for Improvement
- My next goal is to add a back-end to create a fully functional webpage. 
- The webpage is not yet mobile responsive.
